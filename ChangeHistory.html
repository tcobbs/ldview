reloading the file.</li>
<li>Updated so that random colors produce the same colors each time you load a
given model. (That was the original intended behavior. This feature is designed
for parts authors, so having new colors show up every time they reload can be

<li><b>Windows:</b> Added support for DPI scaling (AKA High DPI). Requires
Windows 10 Version 1703 (AKA Creators Update) or later.</li>
<li><b>Windows:</b> Added "LDView.com", a wrapper for LDView64.exe and
LDView.exe that is designed to be used from the command line so that errors and
warnings can be displayed.</li>
<li><b>Windows:</b> Added context help to Save Snapshot options.</li>
<li><b>Windows:</b> Added Save Snapshot options to disable Framebuffer Object
and Custom Pixel Formats.</li>
<li><b>Windows:</b> Added ShowErrorsMessageBox option to show errors in a

<li><b>Mac:</b> Added Retina support.</li>
<li><b>Mac:</b> Added support for QuickLook thumbnails for .ldr and .mpd files.
This can be disabled by unchecking the "Use LDView to generate thumbnails for
LDraw files" check box in the LDraw tab of LDView's Preferences.</li>

</ul>
<b>Updates</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated curve smoothing to not smooth edges that are coincident with edge
lines.</li>
<li>Increased the maximum angle between two surfaces that are allowed to be
smoothed, due to the edge line check added above.</li>
<li>Updated filename handling to use UTF-8 internally everywhere, and whatever
is appropriate for each platform in parts that need to be platform-specific.
This should mean that characters for any language can be used for
filenames.</li>
<li>Antialiased edge lines are now more visible visible around the edges of
transparent geometry, although this has a slight performance penalty.</li>
<li>Updated so that hitting space while the model is spinning will stop the
rotation.</li>
<li>Updated the Model Tree highlight so that if edge lines are enabled, they
show through all solid geometry in the model.</li>
<li>Update default verbosity for command line snapshots and exports to show
errors (but not warnings).</li>
<li>Wrapped LDX... declarations in #ifndef statements to allow them to be
declared in a wrapper file that includes LDView's generated POV file.</li>
<li>Removed "Transparent textures last" option in the Primitives tab of
preferences. It caused problems when it was unchecked, so now LDView always
behaves like it used to behave when this was checked.</li>
<li>Updated default POV file version to 3.7.</li>
<li>Updated to use srgb colors in POV 3.7 (or later).</li>
<li>Updated to disable SaveZoomToFit if ModelSize is specified, since the two
options are mutually exclusive.</li>
<li>Updated LGEO POV export to use LGEO hollow studs even on non-LGEO
parts.</li>
<li>Updated shapshot for parts list to be 800x600 instead of 400x300.</li>
<li><b>Windows:</b> Updated to Visual Studio 2019 compiler. (32-bit version uses
Visual Studio 2017 compiler for Windows XP compatibility.)</li>
<li><b>Mac:</b> Now requires macOS 10.9 Mavericks or later.</li>

<b>Bug Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed texture coordinate memory corruption problem.</li>
<li>Fixed primitive substitution of ring primitives with 2-digit sizes.</li>
<li>Updated primitive substitution to round curve quality up to nearest 16
(except for the minimum value of 8) to fix problem where n-16 primitives
ended up spanning the wrong angle.</li>
<li>Fixed crashes when quads or triangles had to be converted to something else
and their coordinates had too many decimal places.</li>
<li>Fixed problem where textures with alpha blending would produce invalid
snapshot output when Transparent Background was enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed problem where texmaps wouldn't be visible on studs when stud textures
were enabled; this introduces a lesser problem, where no stud texture appears on
studs with opaque texmaps on top, and parts of the stud texture show through if
the texmap is partially transparent.</li>
<li>Fixed problem where edge lines were hidden by texmaps.</li>
<li>Fixed problem where using texmaps on geometry that is not color 16 would
cause corruption.</li>

line endings.</li>
<li>Fixed command line POV exports to include LDView version number.</li>
<li>Fixed error handling during smoothing in POV exports.</li>
<li>Fixed Model Tree highlight to properly deal with different line widths.</li>
<li>Fixed Model Tree highlight to draw edge lines in the highlight color.</li>
<li>Fixed POV export of chrd primitives with a fraction greater than 1/2 when
primitive substitution is enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed POV export of ndis primitives with a fraction not divisible by 8 when
primitive substitution is enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed so that "Random colors" setting does not corrupt exports.</li>

</td>
<td colspan="2">
<b>Additions</b>
<ul>

<li>Added status bar to model tree showing the filename and line number of the
currently selected line.</li>
<li>Added ability to randomize colors (useful for part authoring).</li>
<li>Added view mode toggle to default toolbar (Windows and Mac only).</li>
<li>Added toolbar customization, along with the ability to put a lot of LDView
functionality on the toolbar (Windows and Mac only).</li>
<li>Added OK and Cancel buttons to the MPD dialog.  Hitting OK causes the
selected sub-model to remain selection after the dialog is dismissed.</li>
<li>Added remote control support to Windows version, so other programs can
make LDView perform certain functions.</li>
<li>Added "Overwrite existing snapshot" option to Parts List dialog when
"Show model" is checked.</li>

<li>Added ability to specify step from the command line.</li>
<li>Added ability to specify MPD sub-model name from the command line.</li>
<li>Added "Automatic" aspect ratio setting for POV exports.</li>
<li>Added new !LDVIEW BBOX_IGNORE meta command, to allow you to specify parts of
the model that LDView should ignore during bounding box calculations.  That way,
the default zoom and zoom to fit can be tighter.</li>
<li>Add support for "ri" and "r" ring primitives.</li>
<li>Add support for "r" torus primitives.</li>
<li>Added 64-bit version of the Windows Explorer thumbnail generator plugin, so
thumbnail generation can now be performed on 64-bit versions of Windows.</li>
<li>Added 64-bit Ubuntu package.</li>
</ul>
<b>Updates</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated Linux version to use Qt 4.4/4.5 instead of Qt 3.3.</li>
<li>Removed BFC and Show Axes from the default toolbar (Windows and Mac
only).</li>
<li>Updated examine/fly-through status bar icons.</li>
<li>Changed the Model Bounding Box feature to be a toggle.</li>
<li>Updated full screen mode to not change the display settings if the requested
display mode matches the current display mode.</li>
<li>Updated snapshot save to include MPD sub-model name as part of the default
filename if an MPD sub-model is selected.</li>
<li>Updated LGEO POV export to use LGEO studs even on non-LGEO parts.</li>
<li>Updated automatic part downloading to improve its performance.</li>
<li>Updates library update check to scan all existing part files to determine
the latest update already installed, instead of trying to figure this out based
on the contents of files in the models directory.</li>
<li>Updated handling of quads with colinear points to split the quad into two
triangles at the colinear point in order to avoid T-Junctions.</li>
<li>Improved detection of what version of the parts library is installed.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed problem that caused the view mode icon to show up in the wrong part
of the status bar sometimes, and show the lat/lon when in fly-through mode.</li>
<li>Fixed crash when loading a part with "Part Bounding Boxes Only"
 enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed resize grip on Model Tree dialog to not disappear immediately after
hiding the options.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that caused a crash any time you tried to bring up the screensaver
settings.</li>
<li>Fixed full screen support when used on a second monitor.</li>
<li>Fixed POV export to not apply seams to sub-parts of parts.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that caused the step in the toolbar to not update if you changed
steps while the model was rotating on its own.</li>
<li>Stop applying seams to parts that have been transformed non-uniformly.  This
was causing significant problems with flex tubes, which are stretched to
arbitrary lengths.  The excessive stretching messed up the seam calculation,
causing them to be way too short.</li>
<li>Fixed primitive substitution with 48-segment torus primitives to extract the
proper angle from the filename, instead of 3 times the proper angle.</li>
<li>Fixed steps on toolbar when number of steps is more than 100.</li>
<li>Fixed ring primitive substitution to support n-16rinx.dat files.</li>
<li>Fixed opaque dithered extended colors to not be transparent.</li>
<li>Fixed problem when a new preference set was selected via Apply (not OK) and
the new pref set has a different FSAA state than the previous one.</li>
<li>Fixed it to give an error if the latest update currently installed doesn't
show up on ldraw.org's ptreleases.cgi script.</li>
<li>Fixed Windows Explorer thumbnail generator plugin to not skip some LDraw
files.</li>
<li>Fixed uninstall to perform a reboot if uninstalling the Windows Explorer
thumbnail generator plugin, which often fails to properly uninstall without a
reboot.</li>
<li>Fixed final conditional line in cyls2 primitive substitution to not be
wrong when "Curve Quality" is set to anything other than its default value.</li>

<b>Additions</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>New Cocoa-based LDView for the Mac.</li>
<li>Added basic support for steps.</li>
<li>Added export feature to convert LDraw files into other file formats.
Currently POV-Ray and Stereo Lithography file formats are supported.</li>
<li>Added Model Tree dialog (drawer in Cocoa version) to show a tree with all
the data from the model.</li>
<li>Added MPD model selection to show sub-models inside MPD models.</li>
<li>Added new latitude/longitude rotation mode.</li>
<li>Added dialog to set the latitude/longitude.  (This does not require you to
be in the new latitude/longitude rotation mode.)</li>
<li>Added support for multiple processors, and multi-core processors.
Transparency sorting and conditional line calculations now happen in background
threads when LDView is run on a computer with more than one processor core.</li>
<li>Added option to show the coordinate axes for the model, originating at the
model's origin.</li>
<li>Added support for JPEG snapshots.  The default JPEG settings are set using
rarely-used JPEG compression options that result in much better quality for
computer-generated imagery than is typically achieved with image tools.
(Specifically, LDView uses the 4:4:4 JPEG color sub-sampling by default.)</li>
<li>Added Bounding Box dialog that shows the minimum and maximum coordinates of
the bounding box for the model, and draws that bounding box.</li>
<li>Added view mode that only shows part bounding boxes.</li>
<li>Added support for rotation in examine mode with the arrow keys on the
keyboard.</li>
<li>Added steps to m6459.ldr sample model.</li>
<li>Added -SaveSnapshots command line option to allow multiple snapshots to be
saved at once from the command line.</li>
<li>Added "Transparent background" and "Auto-crop" to the snapshot saving UI.
(Previously, these options were only available via manual registry entries or
command line parameters.)</li>
<li>Added ability to set the 3D portion of the LDView window to various sizes
with standard aspect ratios.</li>
<li>Added ability to use the current LDView aspect ratio in the POV-Ray camera
info command.</li>
<li>Added ability to control the default directory where snapshots and part
lists get saved.  Choices are in the model directory, the most recently used
directory for the given file type, or a specified directory.</li>
<li>Added support for Black_Edge color definition.  Add a color to your
ldconfig.ldr with Black_Edge as its color name (case doesn't matter), and
LDView will use the given color for its black edge lines (assuming that
"Process ldconfig.ldr is checked in the general prefs.)</li>
<li>Added icons from toolbar to corresponding menu items when running in Windows
Vista.</li>

example, toggling edge lines).</li>
<li>Greatly improved the output quality of "Transparent background" snapshots
when antialiased lines are enabled.</li>
<li>Changed snapshot rendering in Windows to do software rendering directly to
an in-memory bitmap when the Pixel Buffer OpenGL extension is unavailable or
disabled.  Previously, it rendered into the window, which caused a window to
appear for command line snapshot renders.</li>
<li>Changed the default setting for conditional lines from off to on.  Note that
since edge lines default to off, this won't be seen until the first time edge
lines are enabled.</li>
<li>Changed the default setting for seams to on.</li>
<li>Rotated 8464.mpd sample model 180 degrees so that it faces forward in the
default viewing angle.</li>

message that the LDraw directory could not be found.</li>
<li>Fixed primitive substitution to work with primitives in the Unofficial/p
directory.</li>

<li>Fixed fly-through speed to be dependent of FPS, so that having a super
high FPS doesn't produce super fast fly-through.</li>

predefined light directions in the Preferences Dialog, and by holding down
Shift and dragging with the mouse.</li>
<li>Added support for light.dat files in LDraw models.  Unless disabled, these
will generate point light sources in the scene, up to a total of 8 lights.</li>
<li>Added ability to use LDView to generate thumbnails of .ldr and .mpd files in
Windows Explorer and Gnome Nautilus.</li>
<li>Made it so dragging with the middle mouse button pans (in addition to
the existing dragging with the left mouse button while holding down
Control).</li>
<li>Added support for anisotropic filtering on video cards that support it.</li>
<li>Added scroll wheel support to QT version.</li>
<li>Added BFC toolbar button to QT version.</li>
<li>Added support for the new !ldraw_org meta-statement to be used in the next

<b>Updates</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Made it so that settings specified on the command line don't get saved as if
they had been specified in the UI.  (For example, -WindowWidth=320 on the
command line would result in LDView launching with a window width of 320 the
next time it was run.)</li>
<li>Updated Zoom to Fit command so that the model remaines auto-centered after
using it.</li>
<li>Moved Errors &amp; Warnings, Show View Info, and Show POV-Ray Camera Info to
a new Tools menu.</li>
<li>Made it so only the main row of an error entry is bold.  Sub-rows are now
non-bold.</li>
<li>Made it so that transparency values of 240 and above are considered opaque.
This was done to get rid of ugly artifacts that show up on the glow-in-the-dark
color, which has a transparency value of 250.</li>

wireframe when stereo is enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed tiled snapshot saves to not ignore the SaveAlpha setting.</li>
<li>Fixed -cg option to support the optional radius portion.</li>
<li>Fixed tiled snapshot saves when PBuffer isn't available to make the image
size an even multiple of the number of tiles used.  It already did this with
PBuffer snapshots.  With non-PBuffer snapshots, you ended up with a border
(usually black) on the top and right sides of the image.</li>
<li>Fixed display glitch in Windows versions when switching the viewing angle
via the toolbar.  Switching the viewing angle via the main menu still has the
display glitch.</li>
<li>Fixed command line snapshot saves to pay attention to the file extension of
the snapshot file specified on the command line, instead of using the
SaveImageType setting.</li>

It now generates an error and skips the child model's reference to its
ancestor model.</li>

(13 Dec, 2005)
</td>
<td colspan="2">
<b>Additions</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Completely new rendering engine, written from scratch.  This allows for
the following enhancements that would have been very difficult before:
<ul>
<li>Significantly reduced memory usage on large models.  Measured reduction on
Orion Pobursky's Imperial Star Destroyer model with all settings set to default:
86%.  The same, but with LDView 3's <i>Memory usage</i> setting set to Low: 90%.
(Note that these are <i>reductions</i> of and 86% and 90%, respectively, meaning
LDView 3 requires 16% the memory LDView 2.1.01 requires on that model with
default settings.)</li>
<li>Significantly reduced load time on large models.</li>
<li>BFC (Back Face Culling) support.</li>
<li>BFC verification support (red back faces and/or green front faces).</li>
<li>Potentially faster rendering.  (Actual speed differences vary significantly
based on video hardware and what settings are set.)</li>
<!--<li>Support for steps (not implemented yet, but coming).</li>-->
</ul></li>
<li>Added a toolbar (which can of course be disabled if desired).</li>
<li>Added support for translation DLLs.</li>
<li>Added a distinction between errors and warnings.</li>
<li>Added detection of more problems and potential problems with model files,
leading to more errors and warnings.</li>
<li>Added support for making the default color transparent.  (Primarily useful
for part authors.)</li>
<li>Added direct access to the help file to the Linux version.</li>
<li>Added primitive substitution support for full-circle versions of new torus
primitives.</li>
<li>Added primitive substitution support for chord primitives.</li>
<li>Added context-sensitive help to the save snapshot dialog.</li>
<li>Added workaround for snapshot corruption that was happening on some video
cards (<i>Don't use Pixel Buffer</i> option during snapshot save).</li>
<li>Added Memory usage option to allow LDView to conserve even more memory.
(This comes at the possible expense of speed.  However, if you're swapping when
the <i>Memory usage</i> setting is set to High, and not swapping when it's set
to Low, then Low will be faster.)</li>
<li>Added support for LDraw search directory list in ldraw.ini using Lars
 Hassing's LDrawIni code.</li>
<li>Added support for spaces in submodel filenames.  (Generates a warning.)</li>
<li>Added extra command line parsing for use when using LDView as a renderer
from LPub.</li>
<li>Added detection of primitive comment so that primitive detection can work on
primitives outside the ldraw\p directory.</li>
<li>Added support for automatic cropping of images (via the command line only;
no UI at this time.</li>
<li>Added new sample model created by Peter Bartfai: 8464.mpd.</li>

<b>Additions</b>
</td>
<td><ul>
<li>Created a version using QT.  This was developed in Linux, but should work in
any Unix-like operating system with OpenGL and QT support and a 32-bit compiler.
(I can almost guarantee it won't work if compiled with a 64-bit compiler.)
RedHat 7.3-compatible Linux binaries available for download.</li>

<li>Added Fly-through Mode.</li>
<li>Added unique specular properties to gold, chrome, and the electrical contact
color to try to better convey their metallic nature.  They still aren't
reflective, but they are now more shiny.</li>
<li>Added support for BaseDirectory setting in [LDraw] section of
ldraw.ini.</li>
<li>Added a menu item to allow you to manually change the LDraw directory once
it has been chosen for the first time.  This is only useful when the old
directory still exists, because LDView checks for it every time it runs and
automatically prompts you if it goes away.</li>
<li>Added "Always on Top" menu item to the View menu to make LDView a topmost
window.</li>

<b>Updates</b>
</td>
<td><ul>
<li>Increased the maximum curve quality to 12, twice the previous maximum of
6.</li>
<li>Got rid of progress panel, and instead show progress in the new status bar.
Canceling a load can now be accomplished either by hitting escape or selecting
the <i>Cancel Load</i> item on the file menu.  Even when the status bar is set
to be hidden, it is shown during image loads to show progress.  Hopefully this
change will remove the image load problems that showed up to varying extents on
varying hardware (particularly for those people who had no problems in LDView
version 1.0).</li>
<li>Updated to display FPS in the status bar if the status bar is visible and
FPS are set to be displayed in the preferences.  FPS is displayed as before
when the status bar is not visible (including in full-screen mode).</li>
<li>Updated OpenGL Driver Info window to be resizable, and added a status bar
listing the number of extensions and WGL extensions.</li>
<li>Incorporated font texture and stud texture into executable, thus removing
those two files from the distribution.</li>

<li>Fixed bug that made it so that changing the specular preference had no
effect if <i>Alternate lighting</i> was checked.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that caused in-frame FPS text to be drawn half its normal width
when stereo viewing was enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that caused the field of view to be greater than 180 degrees with
a really tall skinny window (thus inverting the model).  If your screen
resolution was 1600x1200 or lower, you had to be in stereo mode in order to
witness this bug.</li>
<li>Fixed field of view calculation for tall skinny windows to come closer to
preserving the model's scale (instead of shrinking the model down to
nothing).  This fix probably removes the need for the field of view cap fix
above, but it was done separately.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that caused wireframe cutaway in tall skinny windows to draw the
wireframe portion with the wrong field of view (making the wireframe portion too

0.6.3<br/>
(13 Aug, 2000)
</td>

<b>Additions</b>
</td>
<td><ul>
<li>Added OK/Cancel/Apply to Preferences, and made it so that preference changes
don't go into effect until either OK or Apply is hit.  All options now go into
effect immediately thereafter.  (You no longer have to reload the model after
changing certain options.)</li>

0.6.2<br/>
(29 Jun, 2000)
</td>
<td align="right">
<b>Updates</b>
</td>
<td><ul>
<li>Updated bounding box code to use my own matrix multiply routine (instead of
the OpenGL matrix multiply).  The rest of the code was already using my
routine. These matrix multiplications are all pre-processing, not
real-time.</li>
</ul></td></tr>

<tr><td align="right">
<b>Bug fixes</b>
</td>
<td><ul>
<li>Fixed problems with device context and OpenGL context handling.  This will
hopefully make it run again on non-nVidia hardware.  It definitely works again
with the Microsoft software renderer.</li>

<b>Additions</b>
</td>
<td><ul>
<li>Added ability to put seams between pieces (ala L3P).</li>
<li>Added edge line support (with toggle).</li>
<li>Added high-quality mode for lines (with toggle)--uses glPolygonOffset to
move all filled shapes (triangles and quads) away from the viewer by a little
bit.</li>
<li>Added ability to turn off lighting (useful with edge lines turned on).</li>
<li>Added subdued lighting mode (with toggle), which is about halfway in
between the standard lighting mode and no lighting.</li>
<li>Added wireframe support (with toggle).
<ul>
<li>Added support for fog in wireframe mode (with toggle).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Added asterisk to all the preferences that require the model to be
reloaded.  Put note at the bottom of the panel explaining.</li>

<li>Renderer</li>
<li>Version</li>

<li>Updated Preferences panel to reflect new name.</li>

name.</li>

<li>Completely rearranged preferences panel to handle all the new options.</li>
<li>Added panel to prompt for LDraw directory the first time LDView is run, if
it is not found in either C:\LDRAW or in the LDRAWDIR environment
variable.</li>
<li>Since the old registry settings were lost due to the rename, I
reorganized my registry settings.
<ul>
<li>Added support to my convenience class for sub-folders in the registry.</li>
<li>Changed my main registry path to
<tt>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Travis Cobbs\LDView</tt>.</li>

<b>Bug fixes</b>
</td>
<td><ul>
<li>Fixed RGB values of existing colors to match FAQ.</li>
<li>Fixed lots of memory leaks (which did not really have any effect due to the
fact that you could only view a single model).</li>
<li>Fixed bug in which the same file could get closed multiple times, resulting
in crash (also did not show up due to one-model limit).</li>
<li>Removed a some code that was left over from a previous project.  This is
why the main executable is actually smaller than the previous version.</li>
