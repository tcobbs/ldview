# Note on MIDL and generated sources:
# CMake can automatically handle IDL files if they are listed as sources to add_library
# when using Visual Studio generators. It should invoke MIDL and compile the outputs.
# The generated files (LDViewThumbs.h, LDViewThumbs_i.c, LDViewThumbs_p.c, dlldata.c)
# would be placed in CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR.
# CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR should be an include path for LDViewThumbs.h.
# The .c files are automatically compiled. This is simpler than add_custom_command.
