ldview (4.6) stable; urgency=low

  * Added support for using an LDraw Library Zip file to load parts instead of files in the LDraw directory.
  * Added support for cylh and edgh primitives (not in POV export).
  * Use https for library and unofficial part downloads (except for command line-only OS-Mesa-based ldview).
  * Deal more gracefully with the http 429 (Too many requests) status code. Specifically, don't record a failed download attempt when this code is received, and show an error to the user instructing them to wait a short time and then try reloading the file.
  * Updated so that random colors produce the same colors each time you load a given model. (That was the original intended behavior. This feature is designed for parts authors, so having new colors show up every time they reload can be distracting.)
  * Qt & Windows: Move the LDraw and Extra dirs functionality from the File menu to a new LDraw tab in Preferences.
  * Fixed initial directory creation during unzip of LDraw Parts library.
  * Fixed crash when canceling parts library update at the wrong time.
  * Fix CYLINDRICAL TEXMAP to be right side up.
  * Calculate best guess texture coords for on-axis vertices with CYLINDRICAL TEXMAPs.
  * Fixed problem that resulted in duplicate and/or out of place conditional lines.
  * Fixed problems when edge lines were enabled in POV exports.
  * Use alpha channel for auto-crop when transparent background is enabled.
  * Fixed highlighting of line geometry in the Model Tree.
  * Fixed minor problems with !LDRAW_ORG meta processing.
  * Mac: Fixed opening a file in LDView from Finder.

  * Mac: Now requires macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) or later.

  * Fixed primitive substitution for 48/ cone primitives with 2-digit sizes.
  * Fixed specular and shininess in parent model leaking into child models.
  * Fixed possible threading problem with conditional lines.
  * Fixed possible problem loading preferences.
  * Fixed crash when textures were applied to colored geometry.
  * Fixed problem where a primitive in a user model would prevent subsequent parts in the same model from being detected as being parts.
  * Fixed directly opening a file from LDraw library to recognize the attributes (part, primitive, unofficial) of the directory from which it was loaded.
  * Fixed memory leak in Model Tree
  * Fixed model tree to treat LDraw files as UTF-8.
  * Mac: Fixed possible problem with network address lookup.
  * Mac: Fixed Errors & Warnings dialog to properly refresh when the model is reloaded after changing the Extra Search Folders.
  * Mac: Fixed crash when creating a new preference set on an Apple Silicon Mac with macOS Monterey.
  * Window: Fixed Model Tree search to pick up from the current selection when Highlight selected line is unchecked.
