<I>Please note</I>: this help file mostly documents the Windows version of
LDView, with a few notes about the QT (Linux and Mac) version, and some
specific notes on different conventions in the Mac version.  For the most part,
the QT version has the same functionality as the Windows version, and looks and
acts the same (aside from having a mostly native UI look).  However, certain
features (such as FSAA support) are missing from the QT version, and other
features (such as full screen support) are present with less functionality.  If
you are using a non-Windows version of LDView, please don't expect 100% of the
features documented here to be present (although a very high percentage are
present).  Anywhere this document refers to the QT version of LDView, it is
referring to the version made using the QT user interface library.  The QT-based
version of LDView is currently only available in binary form as a Linux binary
and a (Universal) Mac binary.  This version should work fine if compiled in
other Unix-like operating systems, though (as long QT will compile on them).
</DIV>
<P>
LDView displays LDraw models, and consequently requires that LDraw be
installed.  LDraw can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.ldraw.org/">ldraw.org</A>, along with the up-to-date parts
library.  If you install LDraw in any directory other than C:\LDRAW
(/usr/local/ldraw in the QT version), and don't already have an LDRAWDIR
environment variable, you will be asked the first time LDView loads if you
already have the LDraw library installed.  If you say that you do, you will be
asked to select the directory in which LDraw is installed.  Until you select
the LDraw directory, you will be unable to load a model.  If you respond that
you don't already have LDraw installed, you will be asked if you want LDView to
download it for you.
</P>
<P>
When you run LDView, it will open its main window and immediately present you
with an open file dialog (assuming you didn't specify a file as part of the
launch process).  Select the LDraw .ldr, .dat, or .mpd file you want to view.
It will then display the file in the window.  Note that you can resize this
window.  Also note that if you open a large model, it could take a substantial
amount of time to load.  During this time, the status bar will indicate the
progress of the load.  Hitting Escape, or choosing <A HREF="#CancelLoad">Cancel
Load</A> from the File menu, will cancel the load.
</P>

<P>
LDView on Mac OS X uses the standard Mac convention of using the Command key
instead of the Control key for common activities.  Anywhere in this document
that you see the Control key mentioned, remember that the Command key should be
used instead.
</P>
<P>
The menu layout on Mac OS X is also somewhat different.  The Preferences, About
LDView, and Exit menu items have been moved to their standard location in the
application (LDView) menu (with Exit being renamed to the standard of Quit
LDView).  The recent files list has been placed in a
standard Open Recent sub-menu of the File menu.  And the Edit menu has been
removed, since the only item normally found there in LDView is Preferences.
</P>
<P>
If your mouse only has one button, holding down Control while clicking is
equivalent to using the right mouse button (as is standard).  Additionally, if
you have a laptop with a touch pad that supports two-finger dragging to scroll,
this is equivalent to using the mouse wheel (also as is standard).

<A NAME="LDrawLibrary"></A>
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#0080D0" WIDTH="100%" CLASS="SectionHeader">
	<TR>
		<TH ALIGN="LEFT">
			<FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">
			LDraw Parts Library
			</FONT>
		</TH>
	</TR>
</TABLE>
LDView displays LDraw models, and LDraw models (almost always) make use of parts
in the LDraw parts library. In order to display those models, LDView needs for
the LDraw parts library to be present on your computer, and needs to know where
on your computer the parts library is located.  (If you only want to use LDView
to view models that have been created in the LDraw file format that do not make
use of the LDraw parts library, please see the documentation for the
<A HREF="#VerifyLDrawSetting">VerifyLDrawDir setting</A>.)
<P>
The first time you run LDView, it probably won't be able to find the LDraw parts
library, even if the library is already present on your computer.  If this
happens, LDView will ask you if the library has already been installed.  If you
already have the LDraw parts library on your computer, answer Yes, and then show
LDView where to find the library.
</P>
<P>
If you don't already have the LDraw parts library on your computer, answer No,
and you will be asked if you would like LDView to download the library for you.
As long as you aren't using a proxy server for HTTP connections, you can answer
Yes, and you will be asked where you want the library to be put.  After this,
LDView will automatically download the latest version of the LDraw parts library
from LDraw.org.  Once the library has been downloaded and installed, you can
then view models.  Please note that the LDraw parts library is somewhat large
(over 6MB at the time this was written), so it could take a while to download if
you don't have a fast Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
If you use a proxy server for HTTP connections, tell LDView not to download the
LDraw parts library right now, and then go to the <A HREF="#UpdatesTab">Updates
tab</A> in LDView's preferences and configure your proxy server settings.
</P>
<P>
By default, if LDView encounters a request for a part that it cannot find, it
will attempt to download the part from the LDraw.org parts tracker.  The parts
tracker contains all the unofficial parts that have been submitted for
inclusion in the official LDraw parts library that have either not yet been
approved for inclusion, or have been approved, but not yet been included in an
official release of
the library.  Because unofficial parts can change in ways that aren't compatible
with old models (for example, being rotated), LDView generates a warning any
time it uses an unofficial file that it has downloaded.  Note that if the part
subsequently gets added to the official library, the official version will
automatically be used instead (once you update your parts library), and the
warning will go away.

<A NAME="MouseControl"></A>
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#0080D0" WIDTH="100%" CLASS="SectionHeader">

</TABLE>
LDView has two different modes of user interaction:
<A HREF="#ExamineMode">Examine Mode</A> and <A HREF="#FlyMode">Fly-through
Mode</A>.  By default LDView is in Examine Mode.  You can switch modes by
selecting the mode you want from the <A HREF="#ViewMenu">View Menu</A>.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><B><A NAME="ExamineMode">Examine Mode</A></B></FONT><BR/>
Click the left mouse button and drag around to rotate the model.  If you let
go of the button while the mouse is in motion, the model will continue to
rotate on its own.
</P>
<P>
If you hold down the control key prior to clicking and dragging with the left
mouse button, or if you click the middle mouse button and drag, you will pan the
model instead of rotating it.  The model will be pulled in the direction you
move the mouse. If you accidentally lose the model completely, and can't find
it, you can use the <A HREF="#ResetView">Reset View</A> option on the View menu
to reset the view.
</P>
<P>
If you <A NAME="MouseLightDirection">hold down the shift key</A> prior to
clicking and dragging with the left mouse button, you will change the light
direction.  An arrow will be drawn to indicate the current light direction, and
moving the mouse will rotate the direction that the arrow points, as well as
updating the light direction.  If you have problems getting it back to its
default setting, you can choose one of the <A HREF="#LightDirection">preset
light directions</A> in the Effects tab of the preferences.
</P>
<P>
Click the right mouse button and move it up or down to zoom in or out.  The
speed at which it zooms in or out is based on how far you move the mouse from
where you initially clicked.  If you have a mouse with a scroll-wheel, you can
also use the scroll-wheel to zoom in and out.
</P>
<P>
If you hold down the control key while zooming (either with the right mouse
button or the scroll wheel), you will adjust the cutaway mode instead of
zooming in the camera.  Cutaway mode cuts away everything on the model that
is closer than a certain distance.  This distance is defined by a clipping
plane.  This allows you to look inside models without having to resort to
wireframe mode.  Zooming in with the control key pressed moves the clipping
plane away from the camera, causing more and more of the model to be cut away.
Zooming out moves the clipping plane toward the camera, causing less and less
to be cut away.  Please note that you will likely have to zoom in a ways before
the clipping plane reaches the model, so there will probably be no imediate
result.  If you want, you can have LDView draw the cutaway portion of the model
in wireframe, using the <A HREF="#WireframeCutaway">Wireframe cutaway</A>
option.  Note that this will slow things down considerably, since the entire
model has to be rendered twice.
</P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><B><A NAME="FlyMode">Fly-through Mode</A></B></FONT><BR/>
Click the left mouse button and move it around to turn the camera left, right,
up, and down.  The further you move the mouse from the point you clicked, the
faster the camera will turn.
</P>
<P>
The camera can be moved using the keyboard.  At any time, you can hold down
shift to double the speed at which you move.  The movement keys are as follows:

</TABLE>
LDraw files may contain steps.  If so, you can view the steps in order to see
how to build the model.  However, by default, LDView displays the last step,
which shows the complete model.  Use one of the <i>Step</i> menu items or one of
the step toolbar controls to look at the steps.
<p>
Some programs support some advanced options for steps such as temporary buffers
(so that a sub-section of the model can be initally shown in one location and
then moved to another) and custom rotation angles.  LDView doesn't support this
advanced functionality.  It recognizes the <tt>ROTSTEP</tt> LDraw command, which
is used for steps with a custom rotation angle, but treats it just like a
standard step command.  It ignores all other advanced step commands.
</p>
<p>
LDView only shows the steps in the top-level model that it is displaying.  If
you want to see the steps in a sub-model of that model, you must load the
sub-model directly.  If you want to see the steps in the sub-models of an MPD
file, you must first select the sub-model using the <a href="#MPDDialog">MPD
Model Selection Dialog</a> (available from the <a href="#ToolsMenu">Tools
Menu</a> .  Once you have selected the sub-model as the main model, its steps
can be navigated just as if it were in its own file which you loaded directly.

You can switch to fullscreen mode via the View menu.  To do so, select a color

Fullscreen menu option, or hit Ctrl+Enter.  To exit full screen mode, either
hit Ctrl+Enter again or hit Escape.  Note that this feature does not work
properly on all video cards.  If it doesn't work on your video card, you should
get an error dialog after the screen resolution is changed.  After you dismiss
the error dialog, it should automatically switch back to windowed mode.  While
in fullscreen mode you can spin the model around with the mouse, and zoom in
and out the same way you did in windowed mode.
<P>
As long as your video card supports 2D Windows functionality while in fullscreen
mode, the Open dialog and Preferences dialog can be accessed from fullscreen mode
via their keyboard shortcuts  (Ctrl+O for Open File; Ctrl+Shift+P for
Preferences).  If you are unsure, try Ctrl+O first, and if you don't see an
Open dialog, hit escape to dismiss the Open dialog that you can't see.  F5 for
reload also works--whether or not your video card supports 2D Windows
funtionality from fullscreen mode--but unless you are displaying a file that
someone else on your network is modifying, it's not likely to be very useful.

			Save Snapshot Options
			</FONT>
		</TH>
	</TR>
</TABLE>
When you save a snapshot, the following LDView-specific options show up at the
bottom of the standard save dialog box.
<P>
<I><B><A NAME="SaveSeriesCheck">Save snapshot series</A></B></I> (Default:
<I>Off</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option causes a unique number to automatically be appended to the
filename.  This allows you to save a number of shots of the same model without
having to enter a new filename each time.
</P>
<P>
<I><A NAME="SaveDigitsField">Number of Digits</A></I> (Default: <I>1</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available when save snapshot series is enabled.  It controls
the number of digits in the number that is appended to the filename.  Zeroes are
added before the number to make up the number of digits you select here.  For
example, if you select 3 here, and the number is 5, then 005 will be used in the
filename instead of just 5.
</P>
<P>
<I><B><A NAME="SaveSpecificSizeCheck">Save image with specific size</A></B></I>
(Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option allows you to specify a width and height for the snapshot
image.  Otherwise, the snapshot created will have the same dimensions as the
LDView window.
</P>
<P>
<I><A NAME="SaveWidthField">Width</A></I> (Default: <I>1024</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available when save image with specific size is enabled.  It
sets the width (in pixels) of the resulting snapshot image.
</P>
<P>
Note that if this is bigger than a certain threshold (which differs from one
video card to another), a number of tiles will be rendered and stitched together
automatically to form the full image.  This may cause the actual image width to
be slightly less than the requested width due to rounding.
</P>
<P>
<I><A NAME="SaveHeightField">Height</A></I> (Default: <I>768</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available when save image with specific size is enabled.  It
sets the height (in pixels) of the resulting snapshot image.
</P>
<P>
Note that if this is bigger than a certain threshold (which differs from one
video card to another), a number of tiles will be rendered and stitched together
automatically to form the full image.  This may cause the actual image width to
be slightly less than the requested width due to rounding.
</P>
<P>
<I><A NAME="SaveZoomToFitCheck">Zoom to Fit</A></I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available when save image with specific size is enabled.
Enabling it causes the model to be zoomed to fill up the snapshot, as much as
possible.  (Most models will only fill the image in either the vertical
direction or the horizontal direction, but not both.)  Note that the viewing
angle is left the same, but the model may be panned so that it fits best.
</P>
<P>
The reason this requires the <I>Save image with specific size</I>
check box to be checked is that when you save with a different aspect ratio, it
can effect the cropping of the model.  When creating a snapshot the same size
as the LDView window, you can position the model exactly like you want manually,
and are free to use <I>Zoom to Fit</I> on the View menu prior to taking your
snapshot to produce the same result.
</P>
<P>
<I><B>Misc</B></I>
</P>
<P>
<I><A NAME="NoPBufferCheck">Don't use Pixel Buffer</A></I> (Default:
<I>Off</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option disables the use of a pixel buffer for snapshot rendering.
Use of a pixel buffer can result in a corrupt image on certain video cards with
certain video drivers.  If your snapshots are corrupted, enable this.
Otherwise, leave it disabled.
</P>
<P>
<I><A NAME="TransBGCheck">Transparent Background</A></I> (Default: 
<I>Off</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option causes the backround area of the snapshot to be
transparent, instead of using whatever background color is selected in LDView.
This allows the image to be placed over other images in an editor, or over an
arbitrary background in a web page.  This only works with PNG snapshots, as the
other file formats don't support transparency.
</P>
<P>
<I><A NAME="AutoCropCheck">Auto-crop</A></I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option causes the image to be automatically cropped to be as small
as possible without cutting off any of the actual model.  Note that this can be
useful even when <i>Zoom to Fit</i> is checked, because <i>Zoom to Fit</i>
usually only uses the entire image size in one dimension.
</P>
<P>
<I><B><A NAME="AllStepsCheck">All Steps</A></B></I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option causes LDView to create a separate snapshot image for each
step, with an optional suffix, plus the step number, appended to each image.
</P>
<P>
<I><A NAME="StepSuffixField">Suffix</A></I> (Default: <I>&lt;Empty&gt;</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available when all steps is enabled.  Enabling it causes the
specified suffix to be appended to the filename you enter right before the step
number is appended.  This allows you to accept the default filename (the model's
filename) when creating step images, even if you want something like -Step
appended to the end.
</P>
<P>
<I><A NAME="StepsSameScaleCheck">Same Scale</A></I> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available when all steps and zoom to fit are enabled.
Enabling it causes all step images to be generated with the same scale.  That
scale is calculated by applying the zoom to fit operation to the last step.

The Export command allows you to export your LDraw model to various different
3D file formats.  Currently, the following formats are supported:
<p/>
<table class="SettingsList">
	<tr>
		<th>Extension</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>

</table>
<p>
When you select <i>Export</i> from the <i>File</i> menu, you are presented with
a Save dialog box.  This includes a type selection, where you select the desired
format for the export.  In Windows and on the Mac, there is an <i>Options</i>
button next to the type selection. Some file types have export options, and some
don't.  For those that do, the <i>Options</i> button is enabled.  For those that
don't, it is disable.  Click on it to set the export options for the currently
selected file type. The QT version of LDView has an <i>Export Options</i> menu
item in the <i>File</i> menu that performs the same task as the <i>Options</i>
button.  This dialog will only contain entries for those types that have
options.
</p>
<P/>
<h3><a name="PovExport">POV-Ray scene file:</a></h3>
<p>
LDView's POV-Ray export has numerous options.  The ones that aren't
self-explanatory are all documented via tooltips in the Options dialog.  When
you perform a POV-Ray export, LDView creates a POV-Ray scene file using the
current camera angle from the LDView window, so camera placement before the
export is important.
</p>
<P/>
<h3><a name="StlExport">Stereo Lithography file:</a></h3>
LDView's STL export doesn't have an options.  The STL file that it creates is
monochrome.  This option is mainly intended to allow parts to be exported for
editing in 3rd-party 3D modeling software such as Blender.

</TABLE>
The Latitude/Longitude dialog allows you to change the fiew to a specific
latitude, longitude, and optionally distance.
<P>
Enter the desired latitude and longitude to rotate the model around so that you
are looking at it from the given direction.  Consider an imaginary globe
surrounding the model, centered at the model's center, with the front of the
model lining up with the globe at a the 0 longitude location.  The numbers you
enter rotate the model around such that you're looking down on the globe at the
specified latitude and longitude, with the top of your head facing towards the
north.
</P>
<P>
If you check the <I>Distance</I> check box, the camera will be placed at the
specified distance from the center of the model.
</P>
<P>
The <I>Default</I> buttons reset their associated fields to their default
values.  The default latitude is 30, the default longitude is 45, and the
default distance depends on the model.
</P>
<P>The <I>Current</I> button next to the <I>Distance</I> field sets the distance
field based on the current camera location.  This is useful if you want to take
snapshots of multiple different sized models at the same scale, as you can set
things up for the biggest model, then use the <I>Current</I> button to determine
the appropriate distance, then use that for all the snapshots.
</P>
<P>
The <I>Latitude</I> and <I>Longitude</I> fields don't have a <I>Current</I>
button, because LDView's arbitrary rotations don't usual correspond to a view
that can be produced by this dialog.  However, if you switch to
<a href="#LatLonMode">Latitude/Longitude Rotation</a> mode, the

file using Notepad.  Following that are the line # that contained the error, and
the line of text itself.  Neither of these has any actions associated with it.
Certain errors may contain further information as well.
</P>
<P>
Below the tree view is the <I>Include Warnings</I> check box.  Checking this
will cause LDView to show both errors and warnings.  Unchecking it will hide all
the warnings.  Please note that warnings don't mean there is anything wrong with
the file, so warnings are hidden by default.
</P>
<P>
Beside the <I>Include Warnings</I> check box is the <I>Copy Error to
Clipboard</I> button.  Clicking this will cause all the text from the currently
selected error to copied into the clipboard, so that it can be pasted into
another application.
</P>
<P>
On the right-hand side of the window is a list view containing a set of check
boxes that determine what types of errors should be shown.  By default, all
types of errors are shown.  You can disable any errors you don't care about.
Following are the error types:
</P>
<P>
<I>General error</I><BR/>
You probably won't ever see an error of this type.  It is used for rare
situations that shouldn't ever happen.  (For example, if you delete the LDraw
directory while a model is loading, you might get one of these.)
</P>
<P>
<I>Parse error</I><BR/>
A line in the model file was invalid.
</P>
<P>
<I>File not found</I><BR/>
The model referenced another model which could not be found in any of the
standard search locations (the current directory; the LDraw model, parts, and
p directories; entries in the <A HREF="#ExtraDirs">extra search directories</A>
list).
</P>
<P>
<I>Singular matrix</I><BR/>
The model contains a reference to another model with one of the three dimensions
scaled to zero.  This is generally considered bad form, but is often done when
referencing another file that happens to be two-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
<I>Part transformed non-uniformly</I><BR/>
The model contains a part which has been distorted in some way.  While parts are
rotated and moved around to make up a model, they should seldom if ever be
stretched or skewed.  This usually indicates that the model referencing the part
has a problem.
</P>
<P>
<I>Non-flat quad</I><BR/>
The model contains a quadrilateral (quad) that isn't flat.  There are two
perfectly valid ways to split a quad into two triangles, and they result in
different geometry when the quad isn't flat.  Consequently, non-flat quads are
considered to be errors.  Note that there is a reasonable amount of leeway in
LDView's definition of "flat", so rounding in the file shouldn't trigger this
error.
</P>
<P>
<I>Concave quad</I><BR/>
The model contains a concave quadrilateral.  Concave means that one of the four
points is inside the triangle formed by the other three points.  While not
technically an error, this is considered bad form, and may produce incorrect
results in other LDraw-compatible renderering programs.
</P>
<P>
<I>Bad vertex sequence</I><BR/>
The model contains a quadrilateral whose points are specified in "bow-tie"
order.  In other words, if you visit the points in the order given, you'll end
up with two triangles that meet at a point.  Two of the vertices must be
swapped in order to create the quad that was desired.  Once again, this isn't
techically an error (unless it is in a BFC-certified portion of a file), but is
considered bad form, and may produce incorrect results in other
LDraw-compatible rendering programs.
</P>
<P>
<I>Co-linear points</I><BR/>
The model contains a quad or a triangle that has three or four co-linear points.
When this is detected in a quad, the quad is turned into a triangle (or a line
if all four points are co-linear).  When it is detected in a triangle (all three
points are co-linear), the triangle is turned into a line.  Note that some
people might think that using co-linear points in a quad is a valid way to get
rid of T-junctions (a computer graphic term whose explanation isn't important
here).  However, since there are two legitimate ways to split a quad into two
triangles, and one of those ways results in a triangle and a line (instead of
two triangles), this is <B>not</B> a legitimate way to avoid T-junctions.
</P>
<P>
<I>BFC warning</I><BR/>
The model contains back-face culling (BFC) information that seems unusual (but
is still valid).
</P>
<P>
<I>BFC error</I><BR/>
The model contains back-face culling (BFC) information that is invalid.
</P>
<P>
<I>MPD error</I><BR/>
The model contains multi-part DAT (MPD) information that is invalid.
</P>
<P>
<I>Whitespace</I><BR/>
The model references a sub-model whose filename contains whitespace (spaces
and/or tabs).  While this will work in some programs (including LDView), it
won't work in others, and is discouraged.
</P>
<P>
<I>Part renamed</I><BR/>
The model references a part that has been renamed to a new number (otherwise
known as "moved to").
</P>
<P>
<I>Unofficial part used</I><BR/>
The model references a part that isn't present in the main LDraw directory, but
was found by LDView on the LDraw.org Parts Tracker and automatically downloaded.
</P>
<P>
<I>Model loop</I><BR/>
One of the model's sub-models (or parts) contains a reference to one of its
ancestors.  For example, if you load Test1.ldr, and it has Test2.ldr as a
sub-model, and Test2.ldr has Test1.ldr as one of <B>its</B> sub-models, you will
get this error.  Similarly, if Test2.ldr has Test3.ldr as a sub-model, and
Test3.ldr has Test1.ldr as a sub-model, you will also get this error.
</P>
<P>
If <A HREF="#ShowErrors">Show errors after loading</A> is checked in the
preferences dialog, the Errors &amp; Warnings window will automatically be
displayed when a model is loaded that contains errors that are set to be shown.
It will not be shown if the only errors in the model have been unchecked in the
Errors &amp; Warnings window, the model only contains warnings, or the Errors
&amp; Warnings window isn't set to show automatically.

Check this to include inline links to <A HREF="http://peeron.com">Peeron.com</A>
part images in your generated HTML file.  If you check this, you must have an
active Internet connection in order to see the images when you view the Parts
List in your web browser.  If you don't have an active Internet connection,
you should see the alternate text for the images, which says "View on
Peeron.com".  You can still generate a Parts List with image links using LDView
even when you don't have an active Internet connection; you only need the
active connection in order to see the images when you view the page.
</P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Columns</B></FONT><BR/>
</P>
<P>
<I>Part</I><BR/>
This column has the part name and part image.  The image is only present if
<I>Show part images</I> is checked in the <I>Settings</I> box.  If Peeron.com
has a part image in the correct color, that will be used.  Otherwise, a generic
gray part image will be used, and the background color of the image will be set
to the part color.
</P>
<P>
<I>Color</I><BR/>
This column shows the color of the part.  This includes the LDraw color number,
the color name (if known), and a color sample.  Note that even if you don't
include this column, parts are still separated by color in the list.  (If you're
including the part images, this looks fine; otherwise, it's recommended that you
don't disable this column.)
</P>
<P>
<I>Quantity</I><BR/>
This column contains the quantity for each part in each color.  Note that the
total part count for the model is in the header at the top of the file, and is
not optional.
</P>
<P>
<I>Description</I><BR/>
This column contains the part description (as found in the LDraw file for the
part).  This is the only column that is disabled by default.

This resets all the General preferences to their default values.  As with all
other preference changes, you must hit OK or Apply for the reset values to go
into effect.
</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="GeneralAABox">Antialiasing Box</A></B></FONT><BR/>
<I><A NAME="FSAA">FSAA</A></I> (Default: <I>None</I>):<BR/>
This allows you to select what level of full-scene antialiasing to use.  Note
that if your video card does not support full-scene antialiasing, then
<I>None</I> will be the only available item.  If your video card does support
full-scene antialiasing, then all available FSAA modes should be available to
choose from.
<BR/>
If you have an nVIDIA&#174; video card with Quincunx support, then 2x Enhanced
and 4x Enhanced should show up as options.  These use nVIDIA's advanced FSAA
filter.</P>
<P>
<I>Antialiased lines</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option causes lines to be drawn using antialiasing.  This does not
effect wireframe mode.  Line antialiasing can significantly improve the visual
quality of lines, but it can also significantly impact the frame rate.  This
option may not have an effect if <A HREF="#FSAA">Full-scene
Antialiasing</A> is enabled.
</P>


<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="GeneralColorsBox">Colors Box</A></B></FONT><BR/>
<I>Background</I> (Default: <I>Black</I>):<BR/>
This allows you to set the color used to draw the background behind the model.
</P>
<P>
<I>Default</I> (Default: <I>Black</I>):<BR/>
This allows you to set the default color.  Normally this is only visible when
you load a part directly.  Most models don't ever use this color.<BR/>
Note that edge lines on default-colored objects will be black unless you choose
the exact RGB value used by one of the standard LDraw colors.  The default
custom colors in the color dialog correspond to the first 16 standard LDraw
colors.  Resetting the General preferences also resets these colors.
</P>
<P>
<I>Transparent</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option causes default-colored items to be transparent.
</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="GeneralMiscBox">Misc Box</A></B></FONT><BR/>
<I><A NAME="ProcessLDConfig">Process ldconfig.ldr</A></I>
(Default: <I>On</I>):<BR/>
This controls whether or not LDView processes the ldconfig.ldr file that is now
distributed as part of the LDraw parts library.  This file contains settings
that can effect how LDraw models are displayed.  Currently the only settings it
contains are color definitions.  Enabling this option will use the LDraw.org
standard color definitions; disabling it will use LDView's default color
definitions.</P>
<P>
<I>Show frame rate</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option causes the frame rate to show up in the lower left-hand
corner of the window.  A number is only displayed while the model is in
constant motion.  The easiest way to do this is to spin it (see
<A HREF="#MouseControl">mouse control</A>).
</P>
<P>
<I>Show Axes</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option causes LDView to drawn the XYZ coordinate axes for the
model, with their origin at the model's origin.  The X axis is drawn in red,
the Y axis is drawn in green, and the Z axis is drawn in blue.  The positive
axes are all drawn in bright colors, and the negative axes are all drawn in
dark colors.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="ShowErrors"><I>Show errors after loading</I></A> (Default:
<I>On</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option causes the <A HREF="#ErrorWindow">Errors &amp; Warnings
window</A> to automatically be displayed after loading a model that contains any
errors that have been selected for display in the Errors &amp; Warnings window.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<I>Fullscreen refresh override</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
When checked, this setting allows you to override the default refresh rate used
in fullscreen mode.  Enter a number in the field for the desired refresh rate.
Please note that if the refresh rate you enter is not supported another refresh
rate will be used.<BR/><BR/>

</TABLE>
<P>
<I>Field of view</I> (Default: <I>45</I>):<BR/>
Enter a number in this field to control the field of view (in degrees).  Setting
this to the minimum value of 0.1 will produce an image that is essentially
orthographic.  Setting it to the maximum value of 90 will produce a wide-angle
view.
</P>
<P>
<I>Memory Usage</I> (Default: <I>High</I>):<BR/>
This allows you to have some control over how much memory LDView uses.
Normally, setting this to High will result in the best performance.  However, if
you load a large model that uses more memory than you have available, setting
this to Medium or Low may improve performance.
<BR/>
Please note that while the High setting usually results in noticeably faster
performance than the Medium setting, it usually consumes only marginally more
memory.  The Low setting should produce a much more considerable memory savings.
Note also that if you use LDView to perform command line rendering, or use it as
the renderer in LPub (which is actually command line rendering), the Low setting
will likely be at least as fast as the other settings, and will very likely
actually result in faster performance.
</P>

<P/>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A>Default Save Directories Box</A></B></FONT><BR/>
The default save directories box allows you to decide what directory to use by
default when saving files.  Each save operation has three possible options:
<table class="SettingsList">
<tr>
<td valign="top">Model</td>
<td>The default directory is the same directory as the currently loaded
model.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">Last Saved</td>
<td>The default directory is whatever directory was used last for this file
type.  (The first time you save a file of a given type, the default directory
is the model's directory.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Specified</td>
<td>The default directory is specified in the field to the right of the
drop-down box.  Use the <i>Browse...</i> button to browse for a directory,
or enter it in the field directly.</td>

This resets all the Geometry preferences to their default values.  As with all
other preference changes, you must hit OK or Apply for the reset values to go
into effect.
</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="GeometryModelBox">Model Box</A></B></FONT><BR/>
<A NAME="SeamWidth"><I>Seam width</I></A> (Default: <I>On/0.50</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option allows you to set the width of the seams between pieces
using the up and down arrows to the right.  This setting produces the same effect
as the Seam Width option of
<A HREF="http://home16.inet.tele.dk/hassing/l3p.html">L3P</A>.  The field then
displays the current seam width.  Use the arrows to set the seam width to a range
of numbers between 0.00 and 5.00. Note that setting this to large values can
produce extremely odd results.
</P>
<P>
<I>Part bounding boxes only</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option makes it so that all parts in the model are drawn as just
bounding boxes.  A bounding box is the minimum axis-aligned box that can
completely contain the part.  Geometry that isn't detected as being inside a
part is drawn normally.
</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="GeometryWireframeBox">Wireframe Box</A></B></FONT><BR/>
<I>Wireframe</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option causes the model to be drawn in wireframe.  Note that with
many 3D accelerators, this actually runs slower than when drawing as a solid.
</P>
<P>
<I>Fog</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
This option is only enabled if wireframe drawing is enabled.  Enabling it
causes fog to be used to make it so that the lines that are farther away are
drawn more dimly.
</P>
<P>
<I>Remove hidden lines</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if wireframe drawing is enabled.  Enabling it
causes the solid (non-transparent) portions of the model to hide lines that are
behind them, even though these portions themselves aren't actually drawn.
</P>
<P>
<I>Thickness</I> (Default: <I>0%</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if wireframe drawing is enabled.  It adjusts the
thickness of the lines used to draw the model in wireframe mode.
</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="GeometryBFCBox">BFC Box</A></B></FONT><BR/>
<I>BFC</I> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option turns on back-face culling (BFC).  BFC is a technique that
can improve rendering performance by not drawing the back faces of polygons.
(Only BFC-certified parts have their back faces removed.)
<BR/>
Note that while this can improve rendering performance, it can also slow things
down, so don't assume that enabling this will always result in the best
performance.
</P>
<P>
<I>Red back faces</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available while BFC is enabled.  Enabling it causes the back
faces of polygons to be drawn in red.  This is mainly useful for part authors to
allow them to correctly specify which direction faces should face in order to
BFC certify their part files.
</P>
<P>
<I>Green front faces</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available while BFC is enabled.  Enabling it causes the
front faces of polygons to be drawn in green.  This is mainly useful for part
authors to allow them to correctly specify which direction faces should face in
order to BFC certify their part files.
</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="GeometryEdgeLinesBox">Edge Lines Box</A></B></FONT><BR/>
<A NAME="DrawEdges"><I>Edge Lines</I></A> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option causes the edge lines that outline all the pieces to be
drawn.
</P>
<P>
<I>Show edges only</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if edge lines are enabled.  Enabling it causes
LDView to only show edge lines.  Unless you also select the Wireframe option,
the portions of the edge lines that are hidden by the model will still be
hidden, even thought the model isn't being shown.
</P>
<P>
<I>Conditional lines</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if edge lines are enabled.  Enabling it causes
conditional edge lines to be computed and drawn.  Conditional edge lines show up
as a silhouette of curved surfaces; they are only drawn when they are visually
at the edge of the surface from the current viewing angle.

This option is only available if edge lines and conditional lines are enabled.
Enabling it causes lines to be drawn from the first point of each conditional
line to each of its two control points.  This option is primarily designed for
part authors, so they can verify that the control points are in the correct
location.
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
<I>High quality</I> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if edge lines are enabled.  Enabling it causes
edge lines to be drawn slightly closer to the eye than everything else,
resulting in much better looking lines.
</P>
<P>
<I>Always black</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if edge lines are enabled.  Enabling it causes
all edge lines to be drawn in black or dark gray.  This can be particularly
useful to part authors, as it causes the edge lines for the default color (light
gray) to be much more visible.  Dark gray edges are used on dark colors, and
black edges are used on all other colors.<BR/>
If <A HREF="#ProcessLDConfig"><I>Process ldconfig.ldr</I></A> is checked in the
General Preferences, LDView will look for a entries in ldconfig.ldr with color
names of Black_Edge and Dark_Gray_Edge.  If it finds either entry, it will use
that color instead of black or dark gray.
</P>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="EffectsLightingBox">Lighting Box</A></B></FONT><BR/>
<I>Lighting</I> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option enables lighting.  If you disable lighting, it is strongly
recommended that you enable <A HREF="#DrawEdges">edge lines</A>, unless you are
in <A HREF="#GeometryWireframeBox">wireframe</A> mode.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="QualityLighting"><I>High quality</I></A> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if lighting is enabled.  Selecting this enables
high quality lighting.  The easiest way to see the difference between having
this option on and off is with a baseplate.  If you angle a baseplate until the
<A HREF="#Specular">specular highlight</A> becomes visible (it gets shiny), and
then switch back and forth, you will see that the highlight is located in a
specific location when high quality lighting is enabled, and covers the entire
surface when it is disabled.  Enabling this can significantly decrease
performance, especially with large models.
</P>
<P>
<I>Subdued</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if lighting is enabled.  Selecting this sets the
lighting to a subdued level.  Subdued lighting is about halfway in between
standard lighting and no lighting at all.  This can produce nice results when
<A HREF="#DrawEdges">edge lines</A> are enabled.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Specular"><I>Specular highlight</I></A> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if lighting is enabled.  Selecting this turns on
the specular highlight.  This causes the model to appear shiny.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="AlternateLighting"><I>Alternate setup</I></A> (Default:

This option is only available if lighting is enabled.  Selecting this causes
LDView to use an alternate lighting setup, which may improve performance on some

<I>Use LIGHT.DAT lights</I>(Default: <I>On</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if lighting is enabled.  Selecting this causes
LDView to put point light sources in the scene in the locations where LIGHT.DAT
is used as a part.  LDView uses the color assigned to the light part as the
color for the light source.  Note that at most 8 lights will be shown by LDView
(the first 8 in the file), and if the video card doesn't support 8, then less
will be shown. 
</P>
<P>
<I>Replace standard light</I>(Default: <I>On</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if lighting is enabled and Use LIGHT.DAT lights is
checked.  Selecting this causes LDView to not use its standard light source any
time a model is loaded that contains one or more LIGHT.DAT parts.  Models that
don't contain any LIGHT.DAT parts will still be illuminated using LDView's
standard light source.  Note that using both LIGHT.DAT lights and the standard
light source will often result in too much light, leading to a kind of
overexposure effect. 
</P>
<P>
<I>Hide LIGHT.DAT geometry</I>(Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
Selecting this causes LDView to not display the geometry from LIGHT.DAT parts.
Since the geometry is a small set of 3D coordinate axes, you often don't want to
see it.

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="EffectsStereoBox">Stereo Box</A></B></FONT><BR/>
<I>Stereo</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option turns on stereo mode.  Stereo mode draws two images: a
slightly different one for each eye.
</P>
<P>
<I>Cross-eyed</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if stereo is enabled.  Selecting this sets the
stereo mode to cross-eyed stereo.  The two images are drawn side by side, with
the image for the right eye on the left and the image for the left eye on the
right.  By crossing your eyes and then focusing, you can see a stereoscopic
image.  Many people find it difficult or even impossible to focus with their
eyes crossed.
</P>
<P>
<I>Parallel</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if stereo is enabled.  Selecting this sets the
stereo mode to parallel stereo.  The two images are drawn side by side, with the
image for the right eye on the right and the image for the left eye on the left.
By looking in the distance and then focusing, you can see a stereoscopic image.
This will only work if the distance between the two images is no greater than
the distance between your eyes, so the window will need to be kept fairly
narrow.  Many people find it difficult or even impossible to look at an image in
this way and then focus.
</P>
<P>
<I>Amount</I> (Default: <I>50%</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if stereo is enabled.  The slider controls the
stereo spacing.  A small value will result in a very subtle stereoscopic effect,
as if you were looking at a very large object from a very long distance.  (The
minimum value results in no stereoscopic effect at all.)  A large value will
result in a pronounced stereoscopic effect, as if you were looking at a small
object from a very short distance.

Enabling this option causes the cutaway portion of the model to be drawn in
wireframe.  Hold down the Control key and click and drag up with the right mouse
button to increase the amount of the model that is cut away.  Control right drag
down to decrease the cutaway amount.
</P>

<P>
<I>Monochrome</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if wireframe cutaway is enabled.  Selecting it
causes the wireframe cutaway to be drawn in monochrome.  This isn't available on
all graphics cards.
</P>
<P>
<I>Opacity</I> (Default: <I>100%</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if wireframe cutaway is enabled.  The slider
controls the opacity of the wireframe cutaway.  When Color is selected as the
type of wireframe cutaway to draw this may be fixed at 100% on some graphics
cards.  Also, when color is selected and sort is not selected in the
transparency box, transparent pieces will ignore the opacity setting and be
drawn with the standard opacity for transparent pieces.
</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="EffectsTransparencyBox">Transparency
Box</A></B></FONT><BR/>
<I>Sort transparent polygons</I> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option causes transparent shapes to be drawn in back-to-front
order in order to produce a correct result.  If they aren't sorted, distant
transparent shapes can end up being drawn as if they were in front of less
distant transparent shapes.  Unfortunately, this can cause a significant
slowdown in some models.  This option is mutually exclusive with the use stipple
pattern option.
</P>
<P>
<I>Use stipple pattern</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option causes transparent shapes to be drawn using a stipple
(checkerboard) pattern.  This may be significantly faster on some video hardware,
but with potentially reduced quality.  Using the stipple pattern totally
eliminates the errors that may occur where far transparent objects are drawn in
front of closer ones.  This option is mutually exclusive with the sort
transparent polygons option.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="EffectsMiscBox">Misc Box</A></B></FONT><BR/>
<I>Flat shading</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option causes flat shading to be used.  Note that while flat
shading is less complicated to draw, with a modern 3D accelerator this will not
likely improve the performance at all. Flat shading will only likely provide a
visual difference if you have either <A HREF="#QualityLighting">high quality
lighting</A> or <A HREF="#PrimitiveSubstitution">primitive substitution</A>
enabled, in which case turning on flat shading can produce odd results.  This
option is mutually exclusive with the smooth curves option.
</P>
<P>
<I>Smooth curves</I> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option causes curved surfaces to be shaded as curved surfaces
instead of as facets.  Since this relies on information in the LDraw model file
that was originally designed for a different purpose, not all curved surfaces
will be effected.  This option is mutually exclusive with the flat shading
option.

Enabling this option causes LDView to use its own optimized version of many of
the primitives (such as cylinders, cones, etc).  As well as providing enhanced
performance, this also provides improved visual quality, since smooth shaded
primitives are generated where appropriate.
</P>
<P>
<I>Texture studs</I> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if primitive substitution is enabled.  Enabling
it causes a LEGO&reg; logo to be textured onto all the standard studs.
</P>
<P>
<I>Nearest filtering</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if primitive substitution and texture studs are
both enabled.  Selecting it causes nearest texel texture filtering to be used.
This is the lowest quality texture filtering.
</P>
<P>
<I>Bilinear filtering</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if primitive substitution and texture studs are

</P>
<P>
<I>Trilinear filtering</I> (Default?: <I>Yes</I>):<BR/>

This is the highest quality texture filtering.
</P>
<P>
<I>Anisotropic filtering</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if primitive substitution and texture studs are
both enabled, and your video card supports it.  Selecting it causes anisotropic
texture filtering to be used.  When anisotropic filtering is selected, you can
pick the filtering level on the slider to the right of the radio button.  This
is the highest quality texture filtering.
</P>
<P>
<I>Anisotropic filtering level</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if primitive substitution and texture studs are
both enabled, and anisotropic filtering is selected as the filtering type.  It
adjusts the anisotropic filtering level.  Higher numbers produce higher quality
filtering.
</P>
<P>
<I>Curve quality</I> (Default: <I>9%</I>):<BR/>
This option is only available if primitive substitution is enabled.  It adjusts
the quality of substituted primitives by changing the number of facets used to
draw curved primitives.  Changing this from its default value can lead to holes
in the model between the substitute primitives and other geometry.  Be very
careful with this setting.  Setting it too high can lead to huge slow-downs.
The default setting of 2 (9%) is fine for most models.
</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="PrimitivesMiscBox">Misc Box</A></B></FONT><BR/>
<I>Low quality studs (faster)</I> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option switches to using the low-resolution stud files instead of
the normal-resolution stud files.  This can produce significantly faster
rendering.
</P>
<P>
<I>Use hi-res primitives when available</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR/>
Enabling this option causes LDView to attempt to load hi-res versions of
primitives before loading the standard ones.  The hi-res primitives are
otherwise known as 48-sided primitives, because they approximate circular
features with 48-sided features.  Since not all primitives have hi-res versions,
enabling this can create gaps between the standard resolution primitives and
the hi-res ones.

LDView allows you to do a few things from the command line.  LDView must either
be in your path, in the current directory, or have its complete path specified
on the command line in order to run (just like any other program run from the
command line).  If you are unfamiliar with running programs from the command
line, I would strongly suggest skipping this section.  Even if you are familiar
with running programs from the command line, please note that since LDView is
a normal Windows program, and not a console program, the command prompt may
behave as though LDView has exited immediately after it launches.  It won't
necessarily wait for LDView to exit before giving you another prompt.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><B><A NAME="CommandLineFilename">Specifying a
Filename</A></B></FONT><BR/>
</P>
<P>
You can specify a filename on the command line, and LDView will open that file
(if it exists) instead of presenting you with the initial Open dialog.  You must
either specify the complete pathname of the file, including the extension
(e.g. .ldr, .dat, .mpd), or be in the directory that contains the file when you
run LDView.  Note that if your filename contains spaces, the entire filename
must be enclosed in double quotes.  (This is standard for any Windows command
line with long filenames.)
</P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><B><A NAME="SnapshotFilename">Specifying a Snapshot
Filename</A></B></FONT><BR/>
</P>
<P>
You can use the -SaveSnapshot command line option to have LDView take a
snapshot of your model and output it to the specified filename automatically.
After creating the snapshot, LDView will immediately exit.  Note that this
only works if you also <A HREF="#CommandLineFilename">specify a filename</A> for
model you want to take a snapshot of.  For example:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<PRE>
	LDView MyModel.ldr -SaveSnapshot=MyModel.png
</PRE>
<P>
The image filename must have either .png or .bmp as its extension, and the
appropriate image type will be created accordingly.  Remember that control may
return to the command prompt before LDView has finished executing.  So if your
video card allows this to run without displaying a window, you won't have a
good way of knowing when LDView has finished executing.

All of the options available in the Preferences dialog can be set from the
command line, if so desired.  These are all preceded with a - in order to
indicate that an option is being specified.  Command line settings override
settings in the Preferences dialog.  They may be saved as a persistent preference
if you modify them or other preferences via the Preferences dialog.  Otherwise,
the old values will be used the next time you run the program without specifying
a value for those options on the command line.  Preferences are set on the
command line in the following manner:
</P>
<PRE>
	LDView -&lt;setting 1&gt;=&lt;value 1&gt; -&lt;setting 2&gt;=&lt;value 2&gt; ...
</PRE>
For example, to set the default window size to be 640x480, you would do the
following:
<PRE>
	LDView -WindowWidth=640 -WindowHeight=480
</PRE>
Below is a list of all the possible settings.  Note that while most of these

<A NAME="ZoomMax"></A>
Advanced users can adjust the maximum zoom level.  This isn't something that is
generally useful except to LDraw part authors.  Currently it can only be done by
using the <A HREF="#ZoomMaxSetting">-ZoomMax</A> command line option, or
creating or modifying the following DWORD registry key:
<P>
<TT>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Travis Cobbs\LDView\ZoomMax</TT>
</P>
<P>
The default behavior can be achieved by setting it to 199 (decimal).  Increasing
the value above this allows you to zoom in further.  Doing this results in the
view position moving inside the model.  Decreasing the value below 199 limits
the amount you can zoom in.  Setting it to values less than 100 may produce odd
results, and setting it to zero will cause a division by zero which may produce
a crash, or possibly a corrupted display.
</P>
<P>
Setting it to values significantly larger than 199 may produce odd results as
well.  Anything between 199 and 1000 should be fine, other than the fact that
when the view position moves inside the model you get a cutaway effect.
</P>
<P>
Please note: this setting is not designed to position the camera when using the
command line to launch LDView and take a snapshot.  It only effects the maximum
interactive zoom level, so increasing it will not move the initial camera view
closer to the model.  Decreasing it below a certain threshold will move the
camera away, but this is a side effect of the fact that it won't allow you to be
closer than what you set it to.  If you want to change the default zoom level
of the camera, use the <A HREF="#DefaultZoomSetting">DefaultZoom</A> setting.

<A NAME="DefaultMatrix"></A>
If you want LDView to render an image from a specific angle from the command
line, you can use the <A HREF="#DefaultMatrixSetting">-DefaultMatrix</A> command
line option.  (For an alternative way to do this, see the
<A HREF="#DefaultLatLongSetting">-DefaultLatLong</A> setting.)  The
-DefaultMatrix setting is used to directly specify the rotation matrix applied
to the model, which looks like this:

Note that this is the upper left 3x3 matrix of a standard 4x4 3D transformation
matrix.  It is specified on the command line like the following:
</P>
<P>
<TT>-DefaultMatrix=A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I</TT>
</P>
<P>
For example, to get a front view of your model, use the identity matrix, like
so:
</P>
<P>
<TT>-DefaultMatrix=1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1</TT>
</P>
<P>
If you want to decide on a viewing angle in LDView and then determine the matrix
for it that can be used above, use the <A HREF="#ShowViewInfo">View-&gt;Show
view info</A> menu item.
</P>
<P>
Note that if you use this to specify a default rotation matrix, the <I>Reset
View</I> command will reset the view back to your setting until you use the
<A HREF="#SaveDefaultView"><I>Save Current as Default</I></A> command to change
the default viewing angle to something else.

<A NAME="DefaultLatLong"></A>
Another way to have LDView render an image from a specific angle from the
command line is to use the <A HREF="#DefaultLatLongSetting">-DefaultLatLong</A>
command line option.  (For an alternative way to do this, see the
<A HREF="#DefaultMatrixSetting">-DefaultMatrix</A> setting.)  The
-DefaultLatLong setting is a (mostly) user-friendly way of specifying the
viewing angle.  It is very similar to the -cg option in Lars C. Hassing's L3P
program.  (Note that -cg is also <A HREF="#CameraGlobe">supported</A> by
LDView.)  -DefaultLatLong specifies the latitude and longitude of the camera on
a virtual globe around the model.  It is specified like so:
<P>
<TT>-DefaultLatLong=latitude,longitude</TT>
</P>
<P>
You can produce LDView's standard two-thirds viewing angle by using the
following setting:
</P>
<P>
<TT>-DefaultLatLong=30,45</TT>
</P>
<P>
Note that the optional radius parameter of the -cg option isn't supported by
-DefaultLatLong.  However, you can use the
<A HREF="#DefaultZoomSetting">-DefaultZoom</A> setting to move the camera closer
to or farther from the model.  If you want to put the camera at a fixed
difference, use the <A HREF="#CameraGlobe">-cg</A> option.

			Using LDView as a Screen Saver

</TABLE>
When you use the Windows Installer to install LDView, you are presented with an
option near the end to install it as a screen saver.  If you select this option,
you can use LDView as a screen saver.  Simply select it from the list of
available screen savers, and then configure it as desired.  When using LDView as
a screen saver, you can set most of the settings that are available in standard
LDView, and you can additionally set screen saver-specific settings.  At the
moment, Screen Saver mode is only supported in Windows.
<P>
If you don't use the install program to install LDView, or you don't check the
option to install it as a screen saver and later change your mind, you can
manually install it as a screen saver.  Simply copy LDView.exe into your
Windows System directory, and then rename the file to LDView.scr.  In Windows
95/98/Me, the Windows System directory is usually <TT>C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM</TT>.
In Windows NT/2000, it is usually <TT>C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32</TT>.  In Windows XP,
it is usually <TT>C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32</TT>.  It is important that you use the
<TT>SYSTEM</TT> directory in Win95/98/Me and the <TT>SYSTEM32</TT> directory
otherwise.  If you are unsure where to put it, I strongly recommend that you
run the LDView install program, and make sure to check the option to have the
screen saver module installed.  You can re-install LDView over itself without
any problems, so you don't have to uninstall first.
